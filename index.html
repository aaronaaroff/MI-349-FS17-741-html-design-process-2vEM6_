          <h3>Short Pitch</h3>
          <p>
            Aaron's Dirty Space Pirates represent a classic in space
            adventure. We are lazy, cheating, smelly pirates you know and
            love but now in space.
          </p>
          <h3>Long Pitch</h3>
          <p>
            Where did the good old days of true classic space pirates
            go? Now all you seem to see are the watered down caracitures
            they put in the movies. The over glamourization of real Pirates
            like us that takes place in the 6th Nebula Entertainment district of
            the 4th galactic quadrant is ruining our business. People are
            starting to think that they can come up to us like we are mascots
            from the planet Ploopy's Playhouse. Aaron's Dirty Space Pirates are
            dedicated to making sure people are no longer making that mistake.
            We PROMISE to loot, steal from the weak, steal from the strong, spit
            in babies faces, hurt, destroy, drink, devalue, emotionally neglect
            anyone or anything in order to ensure are customers are getting the
            true space pirate experience.
